    <h2>Project Title: Mindshift Teens – A Safe Space for Growth and Change</h2>
    <p>
      Mindshift Teens is an online community created to support teenagers who are struggling with different challenges in life. 
      It is a safe and welcoming space they can call home — a place to talk openly about life choices, school problems, 
      relationships, and personal struggles without fear of judgment.

    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this project is to guide and inspire teens to make positive life decisions, discover their potential, 
      and build confidence in themselves. It also aims to change the negative mindset some young people have about Africa 
      by promoting hope, self-belief, and a new way of thinking about success, education, and the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through open discussions, mentorship, and motivational sessions, <b>Teens Connect</b> will help young people 
      understand that their struggles do not define them — their choices and determination do.

    <h2>My Story — The Woman Who Raised Me</h2>
    <p>
      I grew up in a house where the head never held the crown.<br>
      A man who calls himself father, but never lifted a finger to build the home.<br>
      A man who says, “I’m the head of this house,” but never paid a fee, never bought a book,
      never fed the fire that kept us warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      All my life, it’s been my mother.<br>
      Her sweat. Her tears. Her prayers.<br>
      From primary to secondary, from university to now — it was her.<br>
      My brother, private school — she paid.<br>
      My sister, private school — she paid.<br>
      Me, still in school — and she’s still paying.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father? He travels to Abuja, works there, or so he says,
      but sends nothing home.<br>
      He insults the woman who built his name.<br>
      Accused her of things she’d never do.<br>
      While she carried his children, while she carried his world,
      he carried only his pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have watched my mother turn suffering into strength.<br>
      Watched her smile with tired eyes and still say, “God will provide.”<br>
      She’s the head, the backbone, the reason we’re still standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      People ask me about my father — I stay silent.<br>
      Because they wouldn’t understand.<br>
      They think he’s the one providing.<br>
      But no.<br>
      It’s the woman who wakes before dawn, and sleeps only when we’re safe.<br>
      It’s the woman who became both father and mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a story of pity.<br>
      It’s a story of power.<br>
      A reminder that a woman — can rise from nothing.<br>
      A woman — can make something of herself.<br>
      A woman — can build a home when the man won’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house we live in? It’s hers.<br>
      Her work. Her faith. Her fight.<br>
      He says, “I don’t have money.”<br>
      She says, “Don’t worry, I’ll find a way.”<br>
      He says, “They haven’t paid me.”<br>
      She says, “God will make a way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And God did. Through her.<br><br>
      So I pray — that God will bless my mother,<br>
      the woman who stood when he wouldn’t.<br>
      The woman who fought when life was unfair.<br>
      The woman who gave me reason to believe that pain doesn’t define you — purpose does.
    </p>
    <p>
      To every daughter listening: never give up.<br>
      Your background does not define your destiny.<br>
      You can rise. You can shine.<br>
      You can be everything they said you couldn’t be.<br><br>
      Because I am living proof — that even when the head of the house falls,<br>
      the heart of a woman can still keep the home alive.
